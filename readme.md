>> matplotlib issue : Problem Cause In mac os image rendering back end of matplotlib (what-is-a-backend to render using the API of Cocoa by default). There is Qt4Agg and GTKAgg and as a back-end is not the default. Set the back end of macosx that is differ compare with other windows or linux os.
I resolve this issue following ways:

Create a file ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc there and add the following code: backend: TkAgg
